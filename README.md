# Python
## One of my favorite languages

This repo contains a combo of standalone jupyter notebooks with extensions .ipynb, and then directories with .py files which work together as an application.

I have attempted to document most of the code. But do reach out if you need extra information on any of my work here.

__All work here is my own__
